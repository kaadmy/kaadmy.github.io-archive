Hello. I'm **KaadmY**.

I make stuff and play games.

I've contributed to a few open source projects, including (but not limited to):

- [Quetoo](https://quetoo.org): Bug fixes and general improvements

I've also made some mods and maps for games:

- [QInvasion](https://github.com/kaadmy/qinvasion): DarkPlaces(Quake1) mod that
adds a wave-based monster invasion gamemode
- [Passture](https://github.com/kaadmy/passture): A 2-team ctf map for
[BZFlag](https://bzflag.org)

I can program, too:

- [Python](https://python.org): ~3 years of experience, slower than a snake
(or Python, get it?)

- C: ~2 years of experience, fast but painful to use cross-platform
- C++: ~3 months of experience and still learning, good language but libraries
are a PITA
- [Wren](https://github.com/munificent/wren): awesome language, there really
isn't anything bad I can say about it
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripting: useful but not very good
for anything outside of batch command scripts
- ...and a slew of other languages I've picked up and probably forgotten about
by now

And last but not least, I play games:

- [Xonotic](https://xonotic.org)
- [Quetoo](https://quetoo.org)
- [Warsow](https://warsow.net)
- ... and many more that I don't actively play anymore.
