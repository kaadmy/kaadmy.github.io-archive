Hello. I'm **KaadmY**.

I make stuff and play games.

I've contributed to a few open source projects, including (but not limited to):

- [Quetoo](http://quetoo.org): Bug fixes and general improvements.

I've also made some mods and maps for games:

- [Pixture](https://github.com/kaadmy/pixture): Subgame for
[Minetest](https://minetest.net) that tries to emphasize survival and
exploration.
- [QInvasion](https://github.com/kaadmy/qinvasion): DarkPlaces(Quake1) mod that
adds a wave-based monster invasion gamemode.
- [Passture](https://github.com/kaadmy/passture): A 2-team ctf map for
[BZFlag](https://bzflag.org).

I can program, too:

- [Python](https://python.org): ~3 years of experience, slower than a snake
(or Python, get it?)
- C: ~2 years of experience, fast but cross-platform build tools are difficult.
- C++: ~3 months of experience and still learning, good language but libraries
are a PITA.
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripting: useful but not very good
for anything outside of batch command scripts.
- ...and a slew of other languages I've picked up at some point and probably
forgotten about by now.

And last but not least, I play games:

- [Xonotic](https://xonotic.org).
- [Quetoo](https://quetoo.org).
- [Minetest](https://minetest.net).
- Quake 1/2/3.
- DooM 1/2 (with [Zandronum](https://zandronum.com) and [Odamex](https://odamex.net)).
- ... and many more that I don't actively play anymore.
