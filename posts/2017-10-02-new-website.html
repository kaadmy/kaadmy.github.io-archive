      <h1>New website!</h1>

      As of October 2, 2017, this website has stopped being generated with Jekyll and is instead now just plain HTML with <a href="https://bestmotherfucking.website">minimal styling.</a>
      <br>

      The styling and some HTML code snippets were taken from <a href="https://bestmotherfucking.website">bestmotherfucking.website</a> since it's simple and already works.
      <br>

      I've also changed the license to CC0 since it's harder for third parties to use MIT for blog posts.
