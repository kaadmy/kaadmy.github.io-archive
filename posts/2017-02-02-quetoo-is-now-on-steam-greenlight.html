      A free and open-source first-person shooter game that I've been contributing to, <a href="http://quetoo.org">Quetoo</a>, has been submitted to Steam Greenlight!

      Quetoo has been making incredible progress in leaps and bounds in 2016, and I sincerely hope to see equally rapid progress this year.

      Go and vote for it on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=850566384">Steam</a>!
